# Teaching a Lesson

## The Principles

These are six principles that are self-evident when explained, but too rare in most instruction. Following these principles will ensure that your lessons are taught well in any lecture.

### Interest
We've all had boring and dull instructors who make you want to pay attention elsewhere. But in our lifetimes, we've also developed fantastic distractions. As an instructor, you're competing against short attention spans, and the short attention spans come armed with better trinkets.

There are tools you can use to keep their attention:
- Motivation. People learn best when they are really interested in the things they are about to learn.
- Enthusiasm and Energy. Your movements, your ennunciations, and presence also commands their attention.
- Variety. Using more than one technique, prop or visual aid

- Realism. If you're teaching something like a skill, they are more likely to pay attention if they believe it is something they will come across.
- Participation. Keep them on their toes by asking questions and being part of the conversation. Pull out their ideas as well, as there will be stories in the crowd that may generate interest, and may also have the side-effect or re-enforcing the lessons you teach. You'll notice this a lot in first aid courses, for example.

### Comprehension.

Every lesson needs to be tailor-made to their audience in order to maintain their attention. In order to ensure what you're teaching makes it through, you need to start at audience's level of understaning, and to keep it at their rate of understanding. If you carry out the following, you'll be able to help the audience take in what's being taught:

- Research and plan before the lesson
    Organize the lesson content. From known to unknown, simple to complex, or whatever makes the most sense _as a student_.

- Review
    Conduct a survey at the start of the lecture. Understand the nature of your canvass

- Ask questions
    Ask questions, and determine what the audience knows so that you can adapt as you go along

- Observe
    Look at body language and reaction both to questions. Know when you're about to lose them, and pay attention if you're teaching a skill so that they are not making mistakes

### Emphasis
It's not enough to dump mass amounts of information. When you carry out a lesson, you need to hammer in the key points: The bare minimum individuals need to know so that they can fill in the blanks on their own in the near to far future.

The following are some things you can do to add some gravitas to any part of your lecture:
    - Oral emphasis is the easiest.
    - Video or sound.
    - Reptition
    - Time Allocation
    - Handouts

### Participation

Some of our best learning is hands-on. If they participate, it means they will have an opportunity to try, and gain the muscle memory.

### Accomplishment

This one is purely psychological. The audience needs to expect some form of accomplishment in learning a lesson. They need to feel like they are on track to learning the material. And they need to feel like they've carried out a significant challenge at the end in order for them to keep their knowledge going in the right direction.

They also:
- Need to know how well they are doing within the lecture. Correct faults, reinforce the good, purge the bad. Give praise, advice, and results to sort all of that out.
- Short quizzes also help with that sense of re-inforcement.

### Confirmation

Follow up. figure out whether what you're being taught is kept together. If people are expecting that they will have to carry out some form of confirmation after the fact, it means that they will have to rememeber more of the lesson. There are many ways you can do a confirmation:

1. Writen tests
2. Supervised practice
3. Homework/Work!
4. Group exercises


## Principles in learning - How to build supports to what you teach.

### Comparisons
Analogies. People are able to learn content if they can relate to it with concepts which they've already known. Sometimes this is real-world examples outside of the classroom, sometimes this is just comparissons to prior material taught.

### Reasons
Explaining why something is done in a certain fashion

### Examples
In a math class, it's never enough to show a theory's form and behaviour. In order to give a student enough to go off of in his course,


# Building a Lesson

## Intros

- Introduce
- Review (if following up on another lesson)
- Give the What - The thing you are teaching
- Give the Why - Why will this lesson be important
- Give the Where. Where will it be used.
- Give the layout of the lessons. The parts of the lesson
- Explain whether there will be a test at the end (Question here on why that would be a good idea)


## Parts
You want to break things into bite-sized chunks. An idea is a part of a topic, and a topic is part of a lesson.

### Topics
A topic should contain the following:
    - Something to start the thing off. An intro, a question, or a comment.
    - The ideas (more on that later)
    - Something to confirm knowledge
    - A confirmation. A question, an exersise.

### Ideas
An idea is the base block of knowledge you need to convey. These parts need to be short as you can make them.

When giving an idea, try to present it with some form of aide. Comparisons, Reasons, Examples and Visual Aides


## Conclusions
Every time you finish a part of a lesson, dial it back like you would in an essay. Explain what you just taught. Pause for questions. If it is a course you're carrying out, this is where you would want to confirm as well!

# Building a Lesson Plan

Every time you carry out a lesson or a presentation, preparation will always mean the difference between an audience who just learned a few neat things and a washout. There's a lot of things a good lesson plan can do:

- Provides emphasis for both the instructor and the audience. Coming prepared gives a confidence boost to the presenter, which in turn, allows the presenter to offer up a little more energy to the crowd
- Helps the instructor on where emphasis can be provided for the lesson
- Helps the instructor understand the aides, equipment and setup he will need to make the class a success
- Helps the instructor keep on time. You only have a certain amount of time to run a lesson. A lesson plan will help that.

## The components of a good plan

### The Cover
In a lesson cover, you remind yourself of the things you need to cover:
- The point of the lesson. What will the students need to learn by the end of it?
- The conditions: time, equipment, class size
- The Points
