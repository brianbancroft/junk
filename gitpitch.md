## Principles of Instruction

These are six principles that are self-evident when explained, but too rare in most instruction. Following these principles will ensure that your lessons are taught well in any lecture.

### Interest
We've all had boring and dull instructors who make you want to pay attention elsewhere. But in our lifetimes, we've also developed fantastic distractions. As an instructor, you're competing against short attention spans, and the short attention spans come armed with better trinkets.

There are tools you can use to keep their attention:
- Motivation. People learn best when they are really interested in the things they are about to learn.
- Enthusiasm and Energy. Your movements, your ennunciations, and presence also commands their attention. 
- Variety. Using more than one technique, prop or visual aid

- Realism. If you're teaching something like a skill, they are more likely to pay attention if they believe it is something they will come across. 
- Participation. Keep them on their toes by asking questions and being part of the conversation. Pull out their ideas as well, as there will be stories in the crowd that may generate interest, and may also have the side-effect or re-enforcing the lessons you teach. You'll notice this a lot in first aid courses, for example. 

### Comprehension. 

Every lesson needs to be tailor-made to their audience in order to maintain their attention. In order to ensure what you're teaching makes it through, you need to start at audience's level of understaning, and to keep it at their rate of understanding. If you carry out the following, you'll be able to help the audience take in what's being taught:

- Research and plan before the lesson
    Organize the lesson content. From known to unknown, simple to complex, or whatever makes the most sense _as a student_.

- Review
    Conduct a survey at the start of the lecture. Understand the nature of your canvass

- Ask questions
    Ask questions, and determine what the audience knows so that you can adapt as you go along

- Observe
    Look at body language and reaction both to questions. Know when you're about to lose them, and pay attention if you're teaching a skill so that they are not making mistakes

### Emphasis
It's not enough to dump mass amounts of information. When you carry out a lesson, you need to hammer in the key points: The bare minimum individuals need to know so that they can fill in the blanks on their own in the near to far future. 


### Participation

### Accomplishment

### Confirmation
